# Chess
Creating a Chess game using the principles of OOP to add, pieces, tiles, sounds, and many more.
My plan is essentially to begin with creating a board Gui. This gui will have a 8x8 of buttons/labels on it that will hold integer values depending on which piece is on which tile. E
Each integer value will represent a piece and each integer value will have its own properties such as only being to move diagonal or iin an L shape(bishop and knight).
I will then add sounds for each piece when it is taken. So, for example, if a knight is taken, I will have a horse neighing. Or if a king is taken I will have the sound of rubble falling as if the kingdom fell
apart.
Plan :      Board-> (tiles ->labels,buttons,colors)->(pieces->rook,king,queen,pawn,bishop,knight)->movement->sounds
